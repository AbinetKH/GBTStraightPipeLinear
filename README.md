# GBTStraightPipeLinear
FEM implementation of GBT for analysis of thin-walled straight pipe members 


GBTStraightPipeLinear is a C++ code currently under development for stress and deformation analysis of straight thin-walled circular pipes based on the Generalized Beam Theory (GBT). This code is based on the PhD thesis: Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) for the analysis of thin-walled circular pipe members, https://e-pub.uni-weimar.de/opus4/frontdoor/index/index/docId/4572
